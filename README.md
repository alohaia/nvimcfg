# nvimcfg

I believe that the comments in my configuration files is detailed enough.

Though you may come across some problems about dependencies which I don't wrote much in my configuration files, almost all of them can be solved by reading the docs.

And finally, I'm thinking about write more about how to install and use neovim with my configuration. It may come out soon or take longer. I'm not sure.
